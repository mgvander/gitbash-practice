# Assignment 0 - Introduction to Git

## Author



## Description

You are to follow the below steps to practice using GIT. This will help prepare you for submitting all of your assignments for this class. The work that you are doing here on the README should be done on this and every future assignment. Also, be sure to read the notes section before you follow the steps.

1. Use the link in canvas to get your own version of the project.

2. Use Git to clone down your version of the project.

3. Update .minttyrc with some sort of color changes. I do not care what you change the colors to. Just change them so they are different.

4. Update README.md (Which is the file you are reading right now) with the missing information for the following sections:

    1. Author
    2. Outside Resources Used
    3. Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program

5. Add/Stage the changes you made.

6. Commit the changes you made.

7. Push the changes you made up to GitHub.

8. Check GitHub.com to ensure that the changes you made were pushed correctly.

## Notes
I have left black space between each section that you need to fill out.

The .minttyrc file is a hidden file, so you may need to turn on hidden files for File Explorer, or use the -a flag from the terminal to see the file.

You do not need to put this .minttyrc file in your home directory like we did for the in-class and actually use these colors in your terminal. We are only using this repository and file to practice work on a very simple repository.

Just because you didn't need any outside resources, or have any problems with this (or future assignments) does not mean you should leave the sections blank. Put the word 'None' if there were/are none. Otherwise I won't know whether you filled out the README completely or forgot to do some of it.

When adding outside resources be sure to add a link to the resource if it was online and also state what you used the resource for. This is to cover your butt and avoid plagiarism of other peoples work.

If you would like to add additional Markdown to the README and need some help on how to write proper Markdown, you can refer to this cheat sheet:
